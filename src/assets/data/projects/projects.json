        "abstract": "We propose ProDebNet, an end-to-end real-time projection deblurring network that synthesizes a projection image to minimize projection blur. The proposed method generates a projection image without explicitly estimating any geometry or scattering characteristics of the projection screen, which makes real-time processing possible.",
